# PerfCheck
 Performance Check

Requires Winlib and Gaklib.

A simple program to show the execution times of your program functions.

To get the analyse you  must perform the following steps:

1. Enable profiling. Turn on DEBUG-Mode of your compiler or define the macro PROFILER *#define PROFILER		1*
2. include <gak/logfile.h>
3. Enable a profile level at start of main: *doEnableProfile(gakLogging::llInfo);*
4. All C++ methods you want to analyze should have the first statement doEnterFunctionEx *doEnterFunctionEx(gakLogging::llInfo, "main");*
5. When profiling is disabled, all profiling functions do not have an effect. So there ist no performance issue in your release build.
6. Run your application.
7. Just start the perfcheck with a CSV-File generated by your program if the profiling was enabled.

Example:
perfcheck c:\temp\gaklib12345.csv

Note: doEnterFunctionEx works in C++-Mode, only.
